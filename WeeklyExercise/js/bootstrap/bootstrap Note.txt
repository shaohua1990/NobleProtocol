Overview: 
	Containers: a contianer to wrap site contents and house our grid system. (container is not nestable)
	.container: responsive fixed width
	.container-fluid: spanning the entire width of your viewport


Bootstrap grid:
	three equal columns: .col-md-4 : it will become stack when on mobile device

	Rows must be placed within container
	rows to create horizontal groups of columns
	only conlumns may be immeditate children of rows
	(.row, .col-xs-4) for quickly marking grid layouts??



	------------------------
	examples:
	1. Media queries:
		a fancy term for "conditional CSS rule"
		Different class, to see which one is dominating.
		(zoom=> screen resolution decrease, but keep same.)
		frame---> screen resolution does not change, but the size of the window get smaller

	2. How grid system works on different devices? 
	Grid options
	See how aspects of the Bootstrap grid system work across multiple devices with a handy table.

	                Extra smallPhones (<768px)|	 Small devices Tablets (≥768px)|	 Medium devices Desktops (≥992px)|	 Large devices Desktops (≥1200px)
	Grid behavior	Horizontal at all times											|Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints
	Container width	None (auto)									750px								970px									1170px
	Class prefix	.col-xs-									.col-sm-							.col-md-								.col-lg-
	# of columns	12
	Column width	Auto										~62px								~81px									~97px
	Gutter width	30px (15px on each side of a column)
	Nestable			Yes
	Offsets				Yes
	Column ordering		Yes


	Testing cases: (stack when on the tablet no matter the colums number)
	Coulumn Wrapping:
		more than 12, the exceeding part wrap to the next time as a unit. 

		col-md-offset-*; left offset

	Nesting columns: put one row in another column
	Column Ordering: push and pull used to change the order of columns.  .col-md-push-*(to the left) .col-md-pull-*(to the right)


	<pre></pre> -------- to show the stand alone code block
	<code></code> ----- colorful block




Bootstrap table:
	Contextual classes: allow to change the background colors of individual row or individual table
	(.active, .success, .warning, .danger)
